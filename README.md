# LSD-SLAM: Large-Scale Direct Monocular SLAM

This fork started from [Thomas Whelan's fork](https://github.com/mp3guy/lsd_slam) which "relieves the user of the horrors of a ROS dependency and uses the much nicer lightweight [Pangolin](https://github.com/stevenlovegrove/Pangolin) framework instead."

Here is Jakob's original description:

> LSD-SLAM is a novel approach to real-time monocular SLAM. It is fully direct (i.e. does not use keypoints / features) and creates large-scale,
> semi-dense maps in real-time on a laptop. For more information see
> [http://vision.in.tum.de/lsdslam](http://vision.in.tum.de/lsdslam)
> where you can also find the corresponding publications and Youtube videos, as well as some
> example-input datasets, and the generated output as rosbag or .ply point cloud.

This repo contains my experiments with LSD-SLAM, for performance, functionality
and structure.   As of March 2016, it diverges significantly from either Jakob
or Thomas's branches in structure (I refactored as a way of learning the code),
but not significantly in terms of functionality.   


**master**  is my working / stable-ish branch.   **aaron_dev** is my
**really** unstable branch.   Other branches are for hardware-specific ports
although in the long run I try to merge those functionalities into master
and use CMake to turn hardware-specific elements on and off.

# 1. Quickstart

My targeted environments are Ubuntu 14.04.2, [NVidia Jetpack 2.0](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/jetpack) for Jetson TX1, and OS X 10.11 with Homebrew.

The most authoritative set of dependencies is stored in the [Travis CI](https://www.travis-ci.org) bootstrap files.  Do:

    .travis/before_install_{osx,trusty}.sh     (may use sudo)
    .travis/build.sh

LSD-SLAM requires these "standard" dependencies: OpenCV 2.4 (with nonfree if you want FABMAP), [TCLAP](http://tclap.sourceforge.net/), Boost, Eigen.   

Also uses these "non-standard" dependencies: Pangolin, g2o,
[g3log](https://github.com/KjellKod/g3log), and optionally the [StereoLabs
Zed](https://www.stereolabs.com/) SDK and [Google
Snappy](https://github.com/google/snappy) for file compression.

By default, LSD-SLAM It will use CMake ExternalProjects to build each of these dependencies automatically.   Note this is the most repeatable path to building the software but will be relatively slow to re-compile as it will update each dependency every time.
Set the appropriate CMake variable `BUILD_LOCAL_* = OFF` to disable local building.

**CMake will not resolve these dependencies correctly when building in parallel
**('make -j'). On the first build, use just 'make'.   Once the dependencies have
**been made (they should be reasonably stable), you can 'make -j' when
**rebuilding just LSD-SLAM.**

If you want to build G2O, Pangolin, etc. yourself, see the `cmake/Build*` files for the CMake flags I use.

## Common problems

    ../lib/lsd_core/liblsdslam.so: undefined reference to `g2o::csparse_extension::cs_chol_workspace(cs_di_sparse const*, cs_di_symbolic const*, int*, double*)'
    ../lib/lsd_core/liblsdslam.so: undefined reference to `g2o::csparse_extension::cs_cholsolsymb(cs_di_sparse const*, double*, cs_di_symbolic const*, double*, int*)'
    ../lib/lsd_core/liblsdslam.so: undefined reference to `g2o::csparse_extension::writeCs2Octave(char const*, cs_di_sparse const*, bool)'

g2o should be built with the system libcsparse provided by the libsuitesparse-dev package.  Ensure the CMake variable  BUILD_CSPARSE=OFF, and that CSPARSE_INCLUDE_DIR and CSPARSE_LIBRARY point to system libraries, not the libraries included in the g2o source code.

    ../lib/lsd_core/liblsdslam.so: undefined reference t to `pangolin::CreateGlutWindowAndBind(std::string, int, int, unsigned int)'

Thomas' Pangolin wrapper assumes Glut has been installed.  I needed to

    cmake -DFORCE_GLUT=ON ..



# 3. Running

Supports directories or sets of raw PNG images. For example, you can down any dataset from [here](http://vision.in.tum.de/lsdslam) in PNG format, and run like;

    ./LSD --calib datasets/LSD_machine/cameraCalibration.cfg  datasets/LSD_machine/images/

I've started to record my performance results in [Performance.md](Performance.md)
